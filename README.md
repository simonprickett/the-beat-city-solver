# the-beat-city-solver

Solves "which UK city or cities contains no letters from the phrase..." problems, often posed on Dean Jackson's The Beat and other BBC Radio Nottingham shows.

I am using the UK Government's [list of cities](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-cities/list-of-cities-html).

## Running Locally

Use any web server to run this locally.  For example, the one built into Python 3:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

This will serve the project on port 8000: `https://localhost:8000`

## Examples

festival -> York
christmas -> Ely, London, Dundee
